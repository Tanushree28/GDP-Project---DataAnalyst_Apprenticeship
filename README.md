# Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Analysis

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** measure the market value for all products and services within a country's borders. 
**GDP Growth Rate** is the percentage increase in GDP from quarter to quarter. 
To avoid double-counting, GDP includes the final value of the product, but not the parts that go into it.
For example, a U.S. footwear manufacturer uses shoelaces and other materials made in the U.S., but only the value of the shoe gets counted; the shoelaces don't.



GDP is be calculated using the formula:

# GDP = Consumptions +  Investments + Government Spending + (Exports – Imports)

# Data Source

This dataset consists of the yearly gross domestic product (GDP) in the current  USD of countries and regions worldwide for the recent 25 years i.e. from 1997 -  2021. 

The data is sourced from the World Bank which in  turn lists as sources: World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National  Accounts data ﬁles.

Since GDP is aﬀected by lots of factors such as education, health, environment,  etc. We will be considering the Financial Sector (which includes Assets, Capital  Market), Economic Policy and Debt (which includes External Debt Net Flow), Public  Sector(which includes Government Sector expenses and Revenue) and Private  Sector(Export, Import and Private Infrasture Investment).
